# Odin Etch-a-Sketch Project

* Working to build a browser version of a sketchpad to fine tune my DOM manipulation skills

## To do

* check that max width and total space is used - 960px
* boxes adapt to space size
* hover/colour change functionality that I don't really understand yet
* If prompt cancel, have to make sure that grid stays at default 16 (maybe just include it as calling the function with the default in the if statement)
